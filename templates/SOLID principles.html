                            <p style="text-align:justify">In object-oriented design, the SOLID principles are the five
                                design principles that help to make the code cleaner, more flexible, and easier to
                                change. The principles were compiled by Robert C. Martin.The name SOLID is an acronym,
                                made up of the names of five principles. They are as follow</p><br>

                            *<b>S</b>ingle responsibility principle (SRP),<br>
                            *<b>O</b>pen-closed principle (OCP),<br>
                            *<b>L</b>iskov substitution principle (LSP),<br>
                            *<b>I</b>nterface segregation principle (ISP), and<br>
                            *<b>D</b>ependency inversion principle (DIP).<br>

                    <p style="text-align:justify"><b>The Single Responsibility Principle :</b>A class should have one,
                        and only one, reason to change. meaning that a class should have only one job.It is very
                        important to follow the
                        principle of Single Responsibility .It is always easier to test one thing at a time, one
                        function at a time.It is very important that the name of the function should be very descriptive
                        as to the action it it
                        performs.For example, when many different teams are working on the same project and keep editing
                        the same class for different reasons, this can lead to incompatible modules.This also makes
                        version control easier. Merge conflicts are another excellent example of this. They appear when
                        different teams
                        change the same file. But if the SRP is followed, fewer conflicts will appear – files will have
                        a single reason to change, and conflicts that do exist will be easier to resolve.


                        Let us look at the example<br>


                        <code>Class User:<br>

                            &nbsp; def __init__(self, num1, num2):<br>
                            &nbsp; &nbsp; self.num1 = num1<br>
                            &nbsp; &nbsp; self.num2 = num2<br>
                            &nbsp; &nbsp; return num1+num2<br>

                            def add(self):<br>
                            &nbsp; pass<br>

                            def save(self):<br>
                            # saves to database
                            &nbsp; pass</code><br>

                        In the above code snippet, the user class not only gets the user but also saves him in a
                        database. The class handles both setting user data requirements and database connection and
                        saving. We ought to have a User class that handles the user data and a database class that
                        handles the DB connection and transactions.


                        In the above example, we have 2 classes, each with one single responsibility. If a class has
                        only one responsibility, they tend to be more reusable, simpler, and propagate fewer changes to
                        the system.

Bits can be transmitted using three mediums: Electricity, light and radio waves. Bandwidth is measured bitrate (no. of bits per second) and it is the maximum transmission capacity and latency is the time taken for a bit to travel. Cables like ethernet are cheap but have more signal loss. Fibre optic cables are expensive but can be used for long distance communication with no signal loss. They have thread of glass to reflect light. Wireless medium used radio signals with different frequencies to transmit and receiving signals which is then later converted to binary format. </p>-->

                                code.The implementations of an interface are independent of each other and don’t need to
                                share any code. If you consider it an advantage that two implementations of an interface
                                share some code, you can either use inheritance or composition.We should be able to add
                                new functionality without touching the existing code for the class. This is because
                                whenever we modify the existing code, we are taking the risk of creating potential bugs.

                            <p style="text-align:justify">It states that subclasses should be substitutable for their
                                base classes. Given that class B is a subclass of class A, we should be able to pass an
                                object of class B to any method that expects an object of class A and the method should
                                not give any incorrect output in that case.when we use inheritance we assume that the
                                child class inherits everything that the superclass has. The child class extends the
                                behavior but never narrows it down.

                                Therefore, when a class does not obey this principle, it leads to inconsistency in code

                                Lets explain this with the example of a Calculator <br>

                            In the above example, the two classes, even though the calculate methods take equal no of
                            arguments, the method in the Divide class could possibly throw a divide by zero error which
                            isn’t a possibility in its parent class (Calculator class) hence a violation of SOLID
                            principles.

                            In another example,the link to code is available in the Git hub link

                            The calculation class is extended by multiplication class, addition subtraction etc.

                            Calculation class is not dependent on its child classes .We should be able to substitute any
                            child class that a parent has.The child class can be a dependent of the parent class but a
                            parent class cannot be dependent on children</p>

                            <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Dependency Inversion Principle</h5>
                            <p style="text-align:justify">The Dependency Inversion principle states that our classes
                                should depend upon interfaces or abstract classes instead on the concrete classes and
                                functions.Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions.In another words,
                                this can be explained asthe high-level module must not depend on the low-level module,
                                but they should depend on abstractions.

                                Let us again take the example of a calculator to demonstrate this principle.</p><br>

                            The simple Calculator class above with two operations works but what if we want to add a new
                            operation, like multiplication or divisiom. Adding a new operation to our current Calculator
                            class will modify the current class. This modification will break the Open close principle
                            of the SOLID principles. So,inorder to add new operations (or “extend”) our Calculator class
                            without actually doing code changes (or “modifications”) to it,Dependency Inversion
                            Principle helps


                            Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.


                            The goal that we want right now is to add a new operation to our Calculator class. Looking
                            at the previous methods Add and Subtract we can safely say that we can actually create an
                            interface or a contract that our Calculator uses.
                            We now have to create two objects that implements the interface

                            With our current code, it is now easy to “extend” and add new operations to our Calculator
                            class without actually “modifying” it.
