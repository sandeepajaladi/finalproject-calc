                                problem of creating product objects without specifying their concrete classes.
                                It defines a method, which should be used for creating objects instead of direct
                                constructor
                                call (new operator). Subclasses can override this method to change the class of objects

                                will be created.</p>

                    <p>
                    <p>Instantiating a class in Python is to instantiate a class, we simply call the class as if it were
                        a function, passing the arguments that the __init__ method defines. The return value will be the
                        newly created object. Example<br>
                        <code>class Foo():<br>
                            &nbsp; def __init__(self,x,y):<br>
                            &nbsp; &nbsp; print x+y <br>
                            &nbsp; &nbsp; f = Foo(3,4)</code>
                    <p><b>3) Object</b> :Object is a member or an "instance" of a class. An object has a state in which
                        all of its properties have values that you either explicitly define or that are defined by
                        default settings.</p>

                    <p><b>4)Class</b>: A Class is a user-defined data-type which has data members and member
                        functions.Data members are the data variables and member functions are the functions used to
                        manipulate these variables and together these data members and member functions define the
                        properties and behaviour of the objects in a Class.
                        If we take the example of class Car, the data member will be speed limit, mileage etc and member
                        functions can apply brakes, increase speed etc.</p>

                    <p><b>5)Namespace</b>:A namespace is a system that has a unique name for each and every object in
                        Python. An object might be a variable or a method. Python itself maintains a namespace in the
                        form of a Python dictionary.A namespace is a collection of currently defined symbolic names
                        along with information about the object that each name references. You can think of a namespace
                        as a dictionary in which the keys are the object names and the values are the objects
                        themselves. Each key-value pair maps a name to its corresponding object.There are four types of
                        namespaces:<br>
                        Built-In<br>
                        Global<br>
                        Enclosing<br>
                        Local.</p>
                    <p><b>6)Constructor</b> : Each time an object is created a method is called and that method is named
                        the constructor .The constructor is created with the function init. As parameter we write the
                        self keyword, which refers to itself (the object). A constructor is called if you create an
                        object. In the constructor you can set variables and call methods.Constructors are generally
                        used for instantiating an object. The task of constructors is to initialize(assign values) to
                        the data members of the class when an object of the class is created. In Python the __init__()
                        method is called the constructor and is always called when an object is created.<br>

                        <code>Syntax of constructor declaration :<br>
                            def __init__(self):<br>
                            # body of the constructor</code> <br></p>


                    <p class="text-justify">
                    <p><b>7)Fixture</b> : Fixtures are functions, which will run before each test function to which it
                        is applied. Fixtures are used to feed some data to the tests such as database connections, URLs
                        to test and some sort of input data. Therefore, instead of running the same code for every test,
                        we can attach fixture function to the tests and it will run and return the data to the test
                        before executing each test.</p>

                    A function is marked as a fixture by âˆ’<br>

                                a value within your Python code. It was specified in PEP 484 and introduced in Python
                                3.5.
                                It provides an way to optionally annotate the types of Python functions, arguments, and
                                variables in a way that can be used by various tools.

                            <p><b> 9) Type cast</b> : In Explicit Type Conversion, users convert the data type of an
                                object to required data type. We use the predefined functions like int(), float(),
                                str(), etc to perform explicit type conversion.This type of conversion is also called
                                typecasting because the user casts (changes) the data type of the objects.</p>

                            Explicit Type Conversion is also called Type Casting, the data types of objects are
                            converted using predefined functions by the user.

                            <p><b>10)Unit test</b>:A unit test is a way of testing a unit - the smallest piece of code
                                that can be logically isolated in a system. In most programming languages, that is a
                                function, a subroutine, a method or property. Generally, when the development process is
                                complete, the developer codes criteria, or the results that are known to be potentially
                                practical and useful, into the test script to verify a particular unit's correctness.The
                                unit test framework in Python is called unittest, which comes packaged with Python.

                                Unit testing makes your code future proof since you anticipate the cases where your code
                                could potentially fail or produce a bug. Though you cannot predict all of the cases, you
                                still address most of them.</p>
